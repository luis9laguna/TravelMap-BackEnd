To run this project you need to create a .env with the following variables.
PORT: In case you are using it in localhost.
DB_CN: Here you need to put the mongodb Database connection.
JWT_SECRET: A secret password to sign your JWT.
FRONTEND_URL: Where you should put your FrontEnd URL for cors.
GOOGLE_ID: To be able to login with google you should create a credentials in google OAuth 2.0.

Besides the .env you need the FrontEnd that is listed in my repositories or access through this link https://github.com/luis9laguna/TravelMapApp

Thanks for checking my project, is a really simple project but really good to learn and practice some basic skills in nodejs and API in general.
